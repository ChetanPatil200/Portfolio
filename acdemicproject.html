           <h4>Bug Tracking System(05/2022 - 04/2023)</h4>
           <p>
            * This project can be used to track the bugs in the project modules and assist in Troubleshooting errors for
             testing and development processes. 
           </p>
           <p>
            * Bug Tracking System is a web based application that is designed to help quality assurance and
            programmers to keep track of reported software bugs in their work.The major component of these is
            database that records information about bugs. 
           </p>
           <p>
            * These project has a unique feature that the bugs will be assigned to a person with the bug ID,description
            and project name.In these project the admin will be having entire authority of maintaining users ,bug
            categories.

           <h4>Automatic light intensity controlled by external light sensing. (04/2021 - 08/2021)</h4>
           <p>* It helps in automatically switching ON and OFF of the light based on external light intensity. </p>
           <p>* The main purpose of this project is to minimize the cost & loss of electricity and also manpower to
            manually turned on and off of the street light. After implementing the Project it should be capable of
            emitting the light when there is darkness around it.
           </p>
            <p>* The objective of this work is to design a device that will automatically controls light intensity. The
                proposed device controls street light intensity by calculating the peak hours. This work explains light
                controlling using Arduino UNO. 
            </p>
            <p>*  After the implementation of the project, it produces ambident light depending upon the surrounding
                 intensity of light. When there is a darkness around the sensor it produces a light and when the light
                 increases the LED bulbs slowly turned off.

            <h4>Automatic Hand Sanatizer. (02/2020 - 09/2020) </h4>
            <p>
                * The project is capable of sensing hand and it dispenses out the sanatizer when there is contact of hand
                near the transparent pipe. The power supply provides the voltage and current for the operation of motor
                and board and its power source is battery and the power supply can be recharged. 
            </p>
            <p>
                * The main advantage is that we don't need any Physical pressure to be applied on it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                * It is environmental friendly as because of the disposal wastages is very minimal, and it can be refilled easily
                 without any technical assistances. 
            </p>

           <h4>Internship on E-Library Management System at Exposys Data Labs (05/2023 - 07/2023) </h4>
           <p>
            * Online Library Management System is a system which maintains the information about the books present
            in the library, their authors, the members of library to whom books are issued. 
           </p>
           <p>
            * It has a feature that when does the book is issued and which has a due date mentioned to a particuar
            person's ID. 
           </p>
           <p>
            * This computerization of library helps in many instances of its maintenances. It reduces the workload of
            management as most of the manual work done is reduced.
